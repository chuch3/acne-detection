# acne-detection

Simple acne detection using YOLOv11 model and OpenCV.

> "Download the yolov5-face model, small one work very well and is small enough. By using the example inference code in repository, create your own inference that will also call your face recognition model. The xyxy that you get from yolov5-face will be used to crop the image, after you crop, you will call recognition model. I did exactly the same as a part of an active speaker detection project, it should be fairly easy"
